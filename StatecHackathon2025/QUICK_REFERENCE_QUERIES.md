## üéØ Simplest Way (Copy & Run)

**File**: [simple_query_df_b3019.py](../../../simple_query_df_b3019.py)

```bash
cd portal/sdmx-mcp-ng
uv run python ../simple_query_df_b3019.py
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ 11 employment/unemployment series
- ‚úÖ 12 months of data (Oct 2024 - Sep 2025)
- ‚úÖ 132 total data points
- ‚ö° Completed in ~3-5 seconds
- üíæ Saved to `df_b3019_table.json`

## üìù Query Cheat Sheet

### Python - One-Liner

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp.client import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

async def query():
    transport = StreamableHttpTransport(url="http://localhost:8811/mcp")
    client = Client(transport)
    async with client:
        return await client.call_tool(
            "plan_and_execute_workflow",
            {"user_request": "Get employment and unemployment data for 2024-2025"}
        )

asyncio.run(query())
```

### Python - Direct URL

```python
import requests

url = "https://lustat.statec.lu/rest/data/DF_B3019/all/all"
params = {"startPeriod": "2024-10", "endPeriod": "2025-10"}
data = requests.get(url, params=params).json()
```

### Bash - cURL

```bash
curl "https://lustat.statec.lu/rest/data/DF_B3019/all/all?startPeriod=2024-10&endPeriod=2025-10"
```

## üí° Natural Language Examples

All of these work with the MCP Gateway:

### Example 1: Simple
```python
"Get unemployment statistics for the last 12 months"
```

### Example 2: Specific
```python
"Fetch employment and unemployment data for 2024 and 2025"
```

### Example 3: Explicit
```python
"Get data from dataflow DF_B3019 for October 2024 to September 2025"
```

### Example 4: Detailed
```python
"Find unemployment dataflows and retrieve monthly data showing unemployment rate, number of unemployed, and active population"
```

## üìä What Data You Get

### All 11 Series:
1. Resident borderers (seasonally adjusted)
2. Number of unemployed (seasonally adjusted)
3. Active population (seasonally adjusted)
4. Unemployment rate (%) (seasonally adjusted)
5. National employment (seasonally adjusted)
6. National wage-earners (seasonally adjusted)
7. Non-resident borderers (seasonally adjusted)
8. Domestic employment (seasonally adjusted)
9. Domestic wage-earners (seasonally adjusted)
10. National self-employed (seasonally adjusted)
11. Domestic self-employed (seasonally adjusted)

### Time Periods:
- **Frequency**: Monthly (M)
- **Default**: Last 12 months
- **Custom**: Specify `start_period` and `end_period`

### Data Format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "header": { ... },
    "dataSets": [
      {
        "series": {
          "0:0": {
            "observations": {
              "0": [14049.82, null, null, null, 0],
              "1": [14049.48, null, null, null, 0],
              ...
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "structure": {
      "name": "Employment, unemployment and unemployment rate...",
      "dimensions": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Advanced Queries

### Filter by Time Period

```python
# Quarterly data for 2024
"Get DF_B3019 quarterly data for 2024"
```

### Specific Series

```python
# Only unemployment rate
"Show me just the unemployment rate from DF_B3019 for 2024-2025"
```

### Multiple Dataflows

```python
# Combine multiple dataflows
"Get unemployment from DF_B3019 and population from DF_B1001 for 2024"
```

## ‚ö° Performance Benchmarks

| Method | Time | Complexity |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Direct SDMX API** | ~1-2s | Low (you build URL) |
| **MCP Gateway** | ~3-5s | Very Low (natural language) |
| **Neo4j + SDMX** | ~6-8s | Low (discovery + fetch) |
