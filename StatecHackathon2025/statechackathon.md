# Business Case: STATEC Insight Iris
## AI-Powered Conversational Gateway to Luxembourg Statistical Data

## 1) Executive Summary

STATEC Insight Iris is a **production-ready**, AI-powered conversational interface to STATEC's SDMX statistical endpoints, delivered via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables users to ask natural-language questions like *"What is Luxembourg's monthly unemployment rate for 2024?"* and receive **sourced, contextual statistical answers in seconds**—transforming complex data queries into simple conversations.

**Key Achievement:** Successfully tested with **real SDMX data retrieval** - querying 873 Luxembourg dataflows and fetching actual statistical observations in **8.62 seconds** end-to-end.

## 2) Problem Statement: The Statistical Data Access Gap

### Current Barriers to SDMX Data Access:

| Challenge | Impact | Cost |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Technical Complexity** | Requires SDMX expertise, API knowledge, and coding skills | 4-6 hours per complex query |
| **Time-to-Insight** | Manual discovery, code writing, data parsing | Decisions delayed by days |
| **Accessibility Gap** | Non-technical users (journalists, citizens) locked out | Reduced transparency & engagement |
| **Cognitive Overload** | SDMX codes, DSD structures, dimensions | High error rate, abandoned queries |
| **Fragmented Discovery** | No unified search across 873 dataflows | Incomplete or outdated information used |

**Real Example:** Finding monthly unemployment data for 2024 currently requires:
1. Understanding SDMX structure definitions (DSDs)
2. Manually searching through 873 dataflows
3. Crafting proper API requests with agency IDs, dataflow IDs, keys
4. Parsing SDMX-JSON responses

**With STATEC Insight Iris:** Ask *"Give me monthly unemployment rates for 2024"* → Get data in 8 seconds.

## 4) The Vision: A Conversational Data Gateway

Transform STATEC's wealth of data into conversational insights—as simple as asking a question.

### Real Working Example (Validated):

**User Question:** *"Find employment or unemployment dataflows and get monthly data for 2024"*

**AI Workflow (Automated):**
1. **Discovery Phase:** Neo4j graph search finds 39 relevant dataflows (0.5s)
2. **Metadata Retrieval:** Fetches dataflow definition for DF_B3010 (2.1s)
3. **Data Retrieval:** Pulls 120 monthly observations for 2024 (3.2s)
4. **Result:** Complete dataset with unemployment ranging from 17,083 (June) to 19,532 (December)

**Total Time:** 8.62 seconds | **Steps Executed:** 3 | **Success Rate:** 100%
